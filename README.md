Progressive enhancement of GT T-Square gradebook

## How
The idea is to use a Chrome extension to hijack the T-Square pages, extract the grade content, format it better, and provide an interface for adding your own grades.

## Why
T-Square looks aweful, but it's the place most professors put course information, so it's also the best space to augment and improve.
